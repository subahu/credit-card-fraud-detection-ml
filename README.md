# credit-card-fraud-detection-ml
This project implements a Credit Card Fraud Detection Model using Gaussian NaÃ¯ve Bayes, a probabilistic machine learning algorithm based on Bayes' theorem. The dataset consists of credit card transactions, and the goal is to classify transactions as fraudulent or Genuine. The model is built using Python, with scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib for analysis and visualization.
