# Credit-card-fraud-detection-ml
Developed a fraud detection model using Logistic Regression, a statistical method for binary classification. The model classifies credit card transactions as fraudulent or genuine based on a real-world dataset of credit card transactions The model is built using Python, with scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib for analysis and visualization.

✅ Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and data balancing
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing fraud distribution and feature relationships
✅ Model Training: Applying Gaussian Naïve Bayes for fraud prediction
✅ Uses datasets like the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset
