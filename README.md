# Credit-card-fraud-detection-ml
This project implements a Credit Card Fraud Detection Model using Gaussian Naïve Bayes, a probabilistic machine learning algorithm based on Bayes' theorem. The dataset consists of credit card transactions, and the goal is to classify transactions as fraudulent or Genuine. The model is built using Python, with scikit-learn, pandas, and matplotlib for analysis and visualization.

✅ Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and data balancing
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing fraud distribution and feature relationships
✅ Model Training: Applying Gaussian Naïve Bayes for fraud prediction
✅ Uses datasets like the Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset
